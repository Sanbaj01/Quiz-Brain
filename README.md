# Quiz-Brain
This is a program to create a fun quiz game.
I created this program on my 17th day of my 100 day Python Challenge Bootcamp.

Here, we pull a list of quiz questions from the internet.
And give the user an option to choose their answer as either True or False.
The program is created in a way to ask 10 questions to the user, and return the number of right answers they gave and test their knowledge.
